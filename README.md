The Odin Project: Knights Travails

Implemented algorithm to determine path of a Knight given 
valid starting and ending coordinates (within an 8x8 
chessboard). 

V1.0
Basic implementation of a possible path the knight may take
to get from Start to Destination. Statically numbered the travelled 
squares on a chessboard graphic in addition to listing the path in 
console log.


Future version to show knight graphic move accross each square of the 
board as it travels to its destination.
